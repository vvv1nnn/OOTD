OOTD is a mobile application for users that would like have a randomly generated outfit created for them if they struggle to decide what to wear each day. Currently, users are able to upload images of their clothing items and sort them into categories. These are then shuffled on click on a separate tab and then that outfit can also be posted to a social media feed.

As of 16/07/2024, the planned features include: functionality allowing users to search/add/remove friends, delete clothing items from their wardrobe, show all clothign items in the profile page as a carousel.

There are also plans to optimise the speed of the app, which may include changing the database or optimising the nesting of the FireBaseDB.
